# Citi_Bike
-This project details an in-depth analysis of Citi Bike's ridership data within the buroughs of New York City between July 2021-June 2022. I chose to analyze this time period as July 2021 was the first month that New York City resumed glimpses of normalcy as the city was 'opened' back up after the Covid-19 Pandemic shut down much of what everyone knew as everyday life for over a whole year. Due to Tableau Public only being able to withstand a specific maximum file size which would've been exceeded had I used the full csv files for each month within the time period I studied.
